/*
    NOTES:
    - Code execution starts from the main() function and runs from top to bottom.
    - std::cout: Standard character output stream used to print output to the console.
    - << (insertion operator): Sends data to the output stream.
    - std::endl: Ends the current line and flushes the output buffer.
    - Comments (// or /* */) are ignored by the compiler and used to explain the code.
